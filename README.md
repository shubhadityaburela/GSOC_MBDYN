1.  The folder Normal_input contains the input files for the cantilever beam which was a standard test case given on the MBDyn website. The plot shown in that folder shows the positions of the 3 structural nodes in X,Y,Z direction. We see that the the structural node at start of the beam shows no displacement as that was given as static, but the other nodes show a deviation from the 0 line in a linear fashion owing the force applied at the structural node 3.

2.  The folder Velociy_input contains the input files for the cantilever beam where we apply a a velocity in the Z direction to the structural node 3 and by the figure we can see that the position of the structural node 3 oscilates from positive to negative region and slowly damps down to zero.
